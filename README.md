# Embedded-Systems

This repository was created in order to upload the labs of ***Embedeed Systems*** *(ECE340)* offered in *E-CE* of ***University of Thessaly***. During the lab we use software of ***Xilinx*** and ***Digilent Zedboard***.

## Labs

- ***Lab 1:*** Floating Point Adder *(and bonus exercise FPU)* written in ***Verilog*** for *Vivado*.
- ***Lab 2:*** Adding FPA ***Custon IP*** to the *FPGA-based System On Chip (SoC)* block using *AXI4 Interconnect* and ***developing*** the ***application*** to control the *functionality* of our *custom IP*.
